Why add structured data to a page?
Adding structured data can enable search results that are more engaging to users and might encourage them to interact more with your website, which are called rich results. Here are some case studies of websites that have implemented structured data for their site:

• Rotten Tomatoes added structured data to 100,000 unique pages and measured a 25% higher click-through rate for pages enhanced with structured data, compared to pages without structured data.
• The Food Network has converted 80% of their pages to enable search features, and has seen a 35% increase in visits.
• Rakuten has found that users spend 1.5x more time on pages that implemented structured data than on non-structured data pages, and have a 3.6x higher interaction rate on AMP pages with search features vs non-feature AMP pages.
• Nestlé has measured pages that show as rich results in search have an 82% higher click through rate than non-rich result pages.
